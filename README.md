# Movies-ETL

## Overview & Purpose
Our client, Amazing Prime, is interested in curating a clean dataset of movies and their respective information for a Hackathon they are sponsoring. The raw data requires extensive cleaning, which is done through the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. Using Pandas, data from Wikipedia and Kaggle are cleaned and merged. SQL is used to form a database containing this dataset.
